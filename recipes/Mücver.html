        <h2>Mücver is a Turkish fritter or pancake, made from grated zucchini. They are typically pan-fried in oil and their batter often includes a mixture of eggs, onion, dill, parsley, flour, and sometimes potatoes and cheese (beyaz peynir or kaşar). They are similar to Jewish latkes and potato pancakes from various cultures.</h2>
